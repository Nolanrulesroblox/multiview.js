Goals of V2 of Multiview.js:

- <s>Use better logic in terms of "Clicking outside of the frame" and loading</s>  Done as of <a href="https://git.nrrinc.net/multiview.js/commit/841d941b89015b7c2855c6c5981979f726d0824e">841d94</a>
- Better looking UI
- <s>Better data loading (i.e. self json, possible caching posts for offline use)</s>
