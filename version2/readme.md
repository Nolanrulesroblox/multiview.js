# Multiview.js

Goals of V2 of Multiview.js:
- Rewrite with cleaner code (i.e. <s>not reinserting html when it can be reused</s> <-- done)
- Use better logic in terms of "Clicking outside of the frame" and loading
- Better looking UI
- Better data loading (i.e. self json, possible caching posts for offline use)
- revise old methods of scripts (aka get rid of checktag)
- send less data over the internet
- use less memeory
- better tracking? (GDPR respecting)




## NOTICE:

this script is <ins> UNSTABLE </ins>.  use at your own risk. in fact, dont use it at all, just use v1 if you <em> really </em> need to use it, which i dont know why.


<em>also changes wont be listed till later as, im too busy writing stuff to think</em>
