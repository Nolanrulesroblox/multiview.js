# Multiview.js

Goals of V2 of Multiview.js:
- Rewrite with cleaner code (i.e. not reinserting html when it can be reused)
- Use better logic in terms of "Clicking outside of the frame" and loading
- Better looking UI
- Better data loading (i.e. self json, possible caching posts for offline use)
- revise old methods of scripts (aka get rid of checktag)
- send less data over the internet
- use less memeory
- better tracking? (GDPR respecting)
